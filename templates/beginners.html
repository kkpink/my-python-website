    <h2>Interpreting and the interpreter</h2>
    <p>Interpretation is the process of translating and executing a program line by line at runtime.
        A program that performs this task is called an interpreter.
        It reads and converts the source code into machine-executable instructions every time the program is run.
        Because of this, interpreted programs cannot be shared as standalone executables —
        the recipient must also have the interpreter installed in order to run the code.</p>

    <p class="mytext">"Interpretation is like having a live translator who readsss your code and explainsss it to the computer one line at a
        time,sss every time you run the program.

        The program that does this issss called an interpreter. It doesn't create a ssseparate, permanent version of your
        code in a language the computer understandssss — it just translates and runsss it on the spot.
        This means if you want to share your code with someone else, they’ll also need the ssssame interpreter
        on their computer — because the code needs to be "translated" every time it runs."-Professor Pytho</p>


    <h2>Compilation and the Compiler</h2>
    <p>Compilation is the process of translating the entire source code into machine code once, before the program is
        run. This translation is done by a program called a compiler.

        The compiler takes your code and creates a new file — often an executable like .exe on Windows — that can be run
        without needing the original source code or the compiler itself. This makes it easy to share and distribute the
        compiled file, since it’s already in a format the computer can understand.

        However, if you make changes to your code, you must recompile it again to update the executable.</p>
    <p class="mytext">"Compilation is like hiring a translator to transsslate your whole book into
        another language once. After that, anyone can read the transsslated book — they don’t need the
        translator anymore. But if you change a chapter, you'll need the transsslator to redo the transsslation."-Professor Pytho</p>
    <h2>Lexis, syntax, and semantics</h2>
    <p>Lexis
        Lexis refers to the vocabulary of a programming language — the valid words and symbols that the language
        understands.
        In Python, for example, words like if, for, print, and def are part of its lexis. These are called keywords.

        Syntax
        Syntax is about the rules that define how you combine words and symbols to form valid statements or expressions.
        If you mess up the syntax, the program won’t run.
        Example: print("Hello") is valid syntax, but print "Hello" (in Python 3) is not.

        Semantics
        Semantics is about the meaning of your code — what the program actually does.
        Even if the syntax is correct, your code might do the wrong thing if the semantics are off.
        Example: total = price - discount is syntactically fine, but it's semantically wrong if you meant to add the
        discount.

    </p>

    <p>Lexis = The valid words (e.g., "run", "cat", "the")

        Syntax = The grammar rules (e.g., "The cat runs.")

        Semantics = The meaning (e.g., does it make logical sense?)</p>
    <h2>Keywords</h2>
    <p>Keywords are special, reserved words that Python uses for specific purposes. You can't use them as variable names
        because they have built-in meaning.

        Examples:

        if (used for conditions)

        def (used to define a function)

        while, for, class, return, etc.

        Think of them as Python’s own vocabulary — like grammar words in a language.</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Instructions (or statements) are lines of code that tell the computer what to do — like commands.

        Examples:

        print("Hello") → tells Python to display “Hello”

        x = 5 → tells Python to store the value 5 in a variable named x

        Every line that performs an action is an instruction.</p>
    <h2>Indentation</h2>
    <p>Indentation is the spacing at the beginning of a line of code. In Python, indentation isn't just about style — it
        defines code blocks.

        For example:

        python
        Copy
        Edit
        if x > 5:
        print("x is greater than 5")</p>
    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments are lines in your code that Python ignores. They’re used to explain what your code does — helpful for
        you or other developers reading it later.

        In Python, comments start with #:

        python
        Copy
        Edit
        # This is a comment
        print("Hello")</p>
